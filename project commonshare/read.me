#Global Certification Landscape Project
Welcome to the Global Certification Landscape Project, a comprehensive initiative designed to unravel the intricacies of the certification ecosystem worldwide. This project is a testament to the power of data extraction, collection, and analysis, aiming to shed light on the global certification dynamics through a meticulously structured approach.

##Project Components
1. Data Extraction from CERTIFIED SUPPLIERS DATABASE
Our journey begins with the extraction of URLs for approximately 1000 companies listed within the CERTIFIED SUPPLIERS DATABASE. Employing Python in tandem with the BeautifulSoup library, we systematically navigate through the database to establish a solid foundation for our data collection phase. This initial step is crucial for identifying the companies that form the backbone of our analysis.

2. Data Collection from Extracted Links
With the URLs in hand, we delve deeper into each company's profile, extracting a wealth of information critical for understanding their role in the global certification landscape. Our data collection process captures the following details:

Company: The official name of the company.
Brand Name: Associated brand name, where available.
Country: The company's base country, including specific regions or cities.
Product Category: The company's range of products, e.g., Fabrics, Babywear, Garments, Home Textiles.
Contact Name: Name of the contact person at the company.
Email Address: Contact email for the company or the contact person.
Address: Physical address of the company.
License Number: Unique license or certification number.
PDF: URL to a PDF document with certification details (where available).
Certification Body: Entity granting the certification.
Expiry Date: When the company's certification expires.
Product Details: In-depth product descriptions and categories.
3. Exploratory Analysis and Visualization
The final leg of our project involves an exploratory analysis to unveil the certification landscape through insightful visualizations. Using Power BI, we create interactive reports that highlight trends, patterns, and distributions within the certification ecosystem. This phase not only enhances our understanding of global certification dynamics but also provides valuable insights for stakeholders.

##Project Deliverables
Links: A file containing extracted URLs of certified suppliers.
Data: A comprehensive database with detailed company information.
Visualization: Interactive Power BI reports and PDF visualizations of the Global Certification Landscape.
Duplicates CSV: A CSV file listing duplicate company entries, aiding in the data cleaning process.
Engage with Our Findings
We invite you to explore the visualizations provided, preferably through the Power BI template for an interactive experience. Our project not only facilitates systematic data collection but also paves the way for a profound understanding of the certification landscape, contributing significantly to the discourse on global certification standards.
